#### Abstract
This study compares Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with traditional machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gaussian Naive Bayes) for multilabel plant pathology classification using the Plant Pathology 2020 FGVC7 dataset from Kaggle. The research evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of deep learning and classical machine learning approaches in handling complex multilabel classification tasks. Employing a ResNet18-based CNN model, we contrast its performance against traditional algorithms using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, training time, and prediction time. Results reveal significant performance differences, highlighting strengths and limitations of each approach in agricultural domains.
